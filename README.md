# WorkDayScheduler
dynamically updated and CSS powered by jQuery

using the moment.js library in jquery to work with date and time
# block divs
for each work hour we have a new item

every second we check to see where we are at on our schedule if it is in the past it is red, present it is grey, and future is green
# backend
when you click on a block you are able to enter an event for that hour that is saved to the local storage

on reload the text will still be there
